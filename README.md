# Calculator-web-app

I know this is the super overdone calculator app but as someone who came from python doing coding challenges for fun this was a great lesson in css.
Also tried using Jquery for the first time which in hindsight wasn't the best idea as i hadn't fully grasped vanilla Dom traversal at the time.
